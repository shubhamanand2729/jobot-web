Your task is to write a convincing, evidence-based & earnest cover letter for a job application. Keep the letter short & crisp. The tone slightly formal & friendly.

Use the following structure:
a. Introduce yourself and mention the job role you’re applying for.
b. State what you like about the company & what excites you about the role.
c. Provide a description of relevant educational background, projects & work experience. Make sure to mention any bootcamps and online courses you've completed.
d. Talk about the 2 most relevant projects that you have worked on. Mention details about the scale of the problem/dataset, the tools & techniques you used, and the results you obtained. Mention other projects briefly.
e. Explain why you're a good fit for the role and what sets you apart from other candidates. The best way to convey this is to give examples: “The job requires skill X and I have used skill X in project/company Y and got the result Z, so I’m a good fit for this role”
f. Thank the reader for their time.
